# MSTI_Form
A scholarship form used at the School of Education CSUMB.
Students are directed to the link where the form resides.
Once the form is submitted, a shared folder in Google Drive 
is created with the students scholarship application information
for review by our staff. The student is then emailed a copy of their
submission for their own records.
